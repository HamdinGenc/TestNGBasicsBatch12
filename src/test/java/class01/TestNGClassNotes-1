********************TestNG************************
TestNG
Is a testing tool tha helps us to structure our test cases using different annotations

Benefits of TestNG:
1.Reports
2.Annotations
example:
@Test ,@before, @beforeclass
3.parallel testing
4.batch execution
5 Assertions, there are two assertions:
1-Hard Assertions,
2-Soft Assertions
6.Data Parameterization

it can be integrated with cucumber,maven and selenium


1.Annotations:
We do not need any main method
annotation is a tag that provides additional information about class, interface or method in testNG

@Test
@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod
@BeforeClass
@AfterClass


1.@Test
You should write your test cases under this annotations.
This is the main annotation TestNg
By default testNG executes the methods in alphabetical order.

2.@BeforeMethod
runs every time before the @Test is executed
also called precondition


3.@AfterMethod
runs after each @test Method
also called post condition


@beforemethod annotation, is precondition that must run before every test case, and the post condition will run after
the test case has ended.

priority:
By default the priority is zero of all the test case
in order to give them a priority order
example:@Test(priority=1)

NoteImp:The execution of the test cases are made according the alphabetical order and that is initialized by
by the tool compiler.

Enabled:
@Test(enabled=false)-->will not run the test cases that are false
by default all the test cases are set to enabled=true

DependsOn:
@Test(dependsOnMethods="MethodName")
will only run if the depend on method has passed successfully else it will be skipped.


HardAssertions:
We have hardAssertions in TestNG;
in order to use the assertion we use

Assert.assertiontype()

1.Assertequals(String1,String2);
it passes if String1 equals String2
if fails if String1 does not equals to String2

2.Assert.Asserttrue(boolean variable);
check the state of boolean variable
it passes if the boolean is True
it fails if the boolean is false

in hard assertions if we have multiple assertions
as soon as one of them fails it quits checking other assertions and declared the test case has failed

SoftAssertions:
Soft assertion continue to check all the assertions regardless of the fact ,
even if one or more assertions have failed, which is not the scenario in case of "Hard Assertions"
(the Hard Assertions stop execution ehn even one assertion fails.)

in order to use soft assertion;
1.declaration

SoftAssert soft =new SoftAssert();
soft.AssertEuqals(string,string) instead of Assert.AssertEquals(string,string)


at the end u must do
3.soft.Assertall();

After the declaration when you use soft.assert it just check
the assertion but does not take any action or display any output.

once all the assertions are done
then use soft.Assertall();
to complie the result of all the assertion and show you the results on screen

extra notes and practice on gITHub.

How to create a git repo.
1.navigate to the location where our project is at.
2.Decide where to create the repo
No SUBREPOSITORIES

3.Initialize the repo
